# Append-only review process

This file records mathematical, provenance, and product review of Homology DB.
It is designed to remain readable by a person and mechanically extractable by
later automation. Entries are appended in chronological order. A correction
adds a new entry that names the earlier record; it never edits the earlier
review verdict or erases the evidence that produced it.

This is a process log, not a source of mathematical truth. A reviewed claim
still belongs in the assertion ledger with its own evidence and lifecycle. A
review entry records what a reviewer saw, how they evaluated it, and what must
happen next.

## Record shapes

Every entry declares a `record_kind`. A `database-run` records all fields
below, using `unknown` or `not-applicable` rather than silently omitting a
value:

```text
review_id:
record_kind: database-run
recorded_at:
reviewer:
reviewer_role: human / agent / deterministic-check
agent_runtime:
repository_commit:
reviewed_content_hashes:
working_tree_state:
snapshot_id:
cohort_or_manifest:
prompt_or_protocol:
exact_commands:
public_operations:
source_pins:
assertion_ids:
evidence_ids:
typed_limitations:
capability_states:
claim_or_edge_verdicts:
follow_up_tickets:
supersedes_or_corrects:
notes:
```

A `human-concern` instead records the reviewer, commit and Snapshot seen,
claim under review, verdict, trigger, follow-up, and correction link. A
`source-audit` records the reviewer/runtime, commit, exact source coordinates,
audit conclusion, human-review state, follow-up, and correction link. A
`product-feedback` record preserves the reviewer, exact message times when
known, source, suggestions, disposition, and follow-up without pretending it
is a mathematical verdict. A `decision` records its owner, inputs, chosen
policy and gates. These entry types do not invent database fields that do not
apply to them.

A stable Steenrod acceptance additionally binds the verdict to the canonical
49-spectrum candidate after review metadata is removed; the pinned spectrum
source; source commit and exact source inputs; logical database; review packet
and coverage report; finalized spectrum Snapshot; 5,828 assertion-review
targets; and 5,829 Editorial-admission targets, including the immutable `tmf`
profile module. Its machine-readable record uses schema
`homology-db.steenrod-acceptance/1`, names Dan Isaksen as reviewer, retains
structured written evidence, and separately names the editorial actor. The
accepted-release path admits the stable-spectrum artifact only when that
external record says `accept` and every binding can be independently
reconstructed from the artifact and pinned source. On acceptance, those
reviews and admissions are
materialized in a separate AtlasSchema v5 ledger. The 52-space Chromatic source
retains its `/1` logical identity, while the finalized spectrum ledger receives
a distinct `homology-db.sqlite-logical/2` identity that excludes only the
physical migration-application timestamp. The deployment gate rematerializes
that ledger and requires two fresh accepted atlas builds to match the checked
artifact byte for byte. Development never manufactures the record. A separate,
explicitly enabled public-preview path may publish the exact imported-unreviewed
candidate for informal feedback. It preserves awaiting-review labels, carries
no acceptance metadata, and remains distinct from the finalized release.

For each substantive mathematical claim or proposed implication edge, a human
reviewer records exactly one of:

- `accept`: clear and adequately grounded for the stated Snapshot and scope;
- `reject`: false, unsafe, conventionally wrong, or contradicted by evidence;
  or
- `needs-evidence`: possibly correct, but not adequately grounded.

`pending-human-review` is a workflow state, not a verdict. Automated checks
may establish that an envelope is complete or a command succeeded, but they
do not silently supply the human verdict. A later review appends the missing
claim-level verdicts.

An implication-edge record additionally names its source nodes, target node,
relation, hypotheses, cited justification, and whether each hypothesis was
actually established. Equal invariants alone never create an identity,
homeomorphism, or homotopy-equivalence edge.

## Correction and concurrency rules

1. Never change or delete an earlier review entry after it has been shared.
2. Append a correction with a new `review_id` and
   `supersedes_or_corrects: <old-id>`.
3. Retain rejected claims, typed limitations, conflicting verdicts, and the
   exact evidence originally reviewed.
4. Bind every database review to one `snapshot_id`; a mismatch is an integrity
   failure, not a result to reconcile manually.
5. Record the repository commit and prompt/protocol version separately from
   the Snapshot. They are different reproducibility axes.
6. Never infer an absent identifier. Use `none-returned` or `unknown`.
7. Give independent reviewers independent records even when they inspect the
   same claim.

## Review `review-2026-07-12-001`: fixed database-connected run

```text
review_id: review-2026-07-12-001
record_kind: database-run

```

Exact preflight commands:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python3 -m homology_db --db /tmp/homology-db-review.sqlite3 demo
```

Every mathematical call used the same database path and this shell envelope:

```bash
python3 -m homology_db --db /tmp/homology-db-review.sqlite3 tool '<JSON>'
```

The run answered R01--R12 in order, reported 12/12 tests passing, used one
Snapshot throughout, and expanded every evidence record used in a lookup or
comparison. Its final response is retained in Codex task
`019f55a2-6b0b-7711-86cf-e716981cb01e`, titled `Review Homology DB answers`.
That task is the complete human-readable claim-to-ID audit; this entry records
its reproducibility coordinates without pretending the agent approved itself.
Its final response lists the operations used for each question, but that
presentation can repeat an earlier shared lookup and is not an exact
chronological tool trace. Review `review-2026-07-12-005` is a
coverage-equivalent replay, not evidence of review 001's original call order.

### Grounding inventory

The following exact assertion IDs grounded displayed group claims:

- R01: `preview:assertion:nonorientable_surface:2:Z:u:0` through
  `preview:assertion:nonorientable_surface:2:Z:u:2`.
- R02: `preview:assertion:real_projective_space:4:Z:u:0` through
  `preview:assertion:real_projective_space:4:Z:u:4`, and
  `preview:assertion:real_projective_space:4:F2:u:0` through
  `preview:assertion:real_projective_space:4:F2:u:4`.
- R03: `preview:assertion:lens:5:2:F5:r:0` through
  `preview:assertion:lens:5:2:F5:r:3`.
- R04: `preview:assertion:torus:4:Z:u:0` through
  `preview:assertion:torus:4:Z:u:4`.
- R05: `preview:assertion:orientable_surface_circle:3:Z:u:0` through
  `preview:assertion:orientable_surface_circle:3:Z:u:3`.
- R06: `preview:assertion:sphere_product:2:4:Z:u:0` through
  `preview:assertion:sphere_product:2:4:Z:u:6`.
- R07: `preview:assertion:disk:4:Z:u:0` through
  `preview:assertion:disk:4:Z:u:4`.
- R08: `preview:assertion:lens:10:1:Z:u:1`,
  `preview:assertion:lens:5:1:Z:u:1`, and
  `preview:assertion:lens:5:2:Z:u:1`.
- R09: `preview:assertion:lens:5:1:Z:u:0` through
  `preview:assertion:lens:5:1:Z:u:3` and
  `preview:assertion:lens:5:2:Z:u:0` through
  `preview:assertion:lens:5:2:Z:u:3`.
- R10: `preview:assertion:sphere:3:Z:r:0` through
  `preview:assertion:sphere:3:Z:r:3`.
- R11: no rational assertion returned; the supported integral lookup was used
  only to obtain subject evidence and was not substituted for the request.
- R12: no assertion returned because the subject did not resolve.

Here “through” is compact notation over the final degree suffix while every
preceding identifier component remains fixed. The exact evidence IDs expanded
were:

```text
preview:evidence:nonorientable_surface:2
preview:evidence:real_projective_space:4
preview:evidence:lens:5:2
preview:evidence:torus:4
preview:evidence:orientable_surface_circle:3
preview:evidence:sphere_product:2:4
preview:evidence:disk:4
preview:evidence:lens:10:1
preview:evidence:lens:5:1
preview:evidence:sphere:3
preview:evidence:sphere:2
```

All expansions named algorithm
`owned-smith-minors-and-modular-rank/0-preview`, an exact chain SHA-256, an
`exact` or explicit `not_computed` representative state, and
`identity_only;nonidentity_not_computed` for induced maps.

Typed limitations retained:

- R11 returned `unsupported_coefficient` for `Q`; this was not reported as
  absence or zero.
- R12 returned `not_found` and `subject_not_resolved` for `CP^2`; no group,
  assertion ID, or evidence ID was invented.
- The `D^4` subject returned `homotopy_equivalent_chain_model`, which the
  answer retained rather than presenting as a counted homeomorphic disk
  presentation.
- Equal integral Homology for `L(5,1)` and `L(5,2)` was not promoted to an
  identity, homeomorphism, or homotopy equivalence.

Claim-level human verdicts remain pending. Passing the deterministic and
agent-envelope checks is not mathematical or UX approval.

## Review `review-2026-07-12-002`: corpus-representativeness concern

```text
review_id: review-2026-07-12-002
record_kind: human-concern
recorded_at: 2026-07-12 (Africa/Johannesburg; exact time not retained)
reviewer: project owner
reviewer_role: human
repository_commit: aa18ebe
snapshot_id: preview-5ea7db464f937061
claim_under_review: the 60-subject preview is representative enough for an external first impression
verdict: needs-evidence
trigger: CP^2 returned a typed missing-subject outcome
follow_up_tickets: ticket 08; external reviewer handoff
supersedes_or_corrects: none
```

The concern did not reject the typed outcome: unresolved `CP^2` was the honest
answer for that Snapshot. It questioned the selection's external usefulness
and prompted a primary-source survey of recognizable examples. The requested
direction is to give Gabriel Ong and Dan Isaksen a reviewable artifact before
hosting, then use their recorded feedback to prioritize polish.

## Review `review-2026-07-12-003`: common-example source audit

```text
review_id: review-2026-07-12-003
record_kind: source-audit
recorded_at: 2026-07-12 (Africa/Johannesburg; exact time not retained)
reviewer: Codex primary-source research pass
reviewer_role: agent
agent_runtime: Codex background research agent; exact model/runtime identifier not retained
repository_commit: aa18ebe
snapshot_id: not-applicable (source/corpus audit, not a database run)
source_pins: repository corpus contract and source-lock audit; Hatcher; May; Sage topology catalog; Isaksen--Wang--Xu
human_review_state: pending-human-review
follow_up_tickets: ticket 08; ticket 12
supersedes_or_corrects: none
```

The audit established a repository fact: `CP^2` is already selected in the
planned 174-space corpus and has a pinned SageMath 10.9 route to a literal
9-vertex, 36-facet triangulation. It is missing only from the deliberately
hand-built `local-preview-60`; it has not yet passed through neutral export,
qualification, owned general-chain computation, and Snapshot assertion
creation. Familiar mathematical knowledge is not a substitute for that path.

The concrete source coordinates used by the audit were:

- SageMath release `10.9`, commit
  `686dc1a8d420c2e0aabadd4f602d9a0aa4690c50`, callable
  `simplicial_complexes.ComplexProjectivePlane()` in
  `src/sage/topology/simplicial_complex_examples.py`;
- [Sage's topology-example documentation](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/topology/sage/topology/simplicial_complex_examples.html);
- [Hatcher, *Algebraic Topology*](https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATpage.html);
- [May, *A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology*](https://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/CONCISE/ConciseRevised.pdf); and
- [Isaksen--Wang--Xu, *Stable homotopy groups of spheres*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04247).

No neutral `CP^2` artifact hash exists yet because materialization is the
uncompleted work being gated. The repository source-lock audit pins the recipe
without pretending that its output has already been ingested or qualified.

The resulting priority order is recorded in
[Common-example priorities](research/common-examples-review.md): `CP^2` and a
small Moore-space slice, the Poincare homology sphere, then K3 and `HP^2`,
followed by finite constructions. `BG`, `K(A,n)`, Thom spaces, and spectra
remain later bounded or newly modeled objects rather than mislabeled finite
Models. This is a qualitative reference-utility survey, not a citation-count
measurement.

## Decision `decision-2026-07-12-001`: external review before hosting

```text
record_kind: decision
recorded_at: 2026-07-12 (Africa/Johannesburg; exact time not retained)
decision_owner: project owner
decision: send the local preview to Gabriel Ong and Dan Isaksen before public hosting
inputs: review-2026-07-12-001 through review-2026-07-12-003
hosting_gate: at least one recorded external review and no open critical mathematical-safety or provenance defect
first_polish_blocker: qualify CP^2 through the pinned Model and owned general-chain path
cohort_policy: preserve local-preview-60; create a separately named external-review cohort
```

The reviewer procedure and feedback form are in
[External review](EXTERNAL_REVIEW.md). A later entry must record each external
review independently, including the commit, Snapshot, exact prompt and
commands, agent/runtime when visible, claim-level verdicts, and follow-up
tickets. No favorable verdict is assumed here.

The prompt was manually replayed against exactly one database built by:

```bash
python3 -m homology_db --db /tmp/homology-db-adversarial-review.sqlite3 demo
```

Every subsequent operation used that path and the documented JSON `tool`
envelope. This is the exact ordered payload trace:

```jsonl
01 {"tool":"resolve_subject","arguments":{"query":"CP^2"}}
02 {"tool":"read_homology","arguments":{"subject":"CP^2","coefficient":"Z"}}
03 {"tool":"resolve_subject","arguments":{"query":"S^2"}}
04 {"tool":"read_homology","arguments":{"subject":"S^2","coefficient":"Q"}}
05 {"tool":"read_homology","arguments":{"subject":"sphere:2","coefficient":"Z"}}
06 {"tool":"expand_evidence","arguments":{"evidence_ids":["preview:evidence:sphere:2"]}}
07 {"tool":"resolve_subject","arguments":{"query":"L(5,1)"}}
08 {"tool":"resolve_subject","arguments":{"query":"L(5,2)"}}
09 {"tool":"read_homology","arguments":{"subject":"lens:5:1","coefficient":"Z"}}
10 {"tool":"read_homology","arguments":{"subject":"lens:5:2","coefficient":"Z"}}
11 {"tool":"read_homology","arguments":{"subject":"lens:5:2","coefficient":"F5","reduced":true}}
12 {"tool":"expand_evidence","arguments":{"evidence_ids":["preview:evidence:lens:5:1","preview:evidence:lens:5:2"]}}
13 {"tool":"query_examples","arguments":{"pattern":{"degree":1,"torsion_prime":5,"limit":20}}}
14 {"tool":"read_homology","arguments":{"subject":"lens:10:1","coefficient":"Z"}}
15 {"tool":"expand_evidence","arguments":{"evidence_ids":["preview:evidence:lens:10:1","preview:evidence:lens:5:1","preview:evidence:lens:5:2"]}}
```

The replay observed:

1. `CP^2`: `not_found` followed by `subject_not_resolved`, with no invented
   assertion or evidence;
2. rational `S^2`: `unsupported_coefficient`, followed only by a supported
   integral lookup to expand `preview:evidence:sphere:2`;
3. `L(5,1)` versus `L(5,2)`: separately resolved integral groups and expanded
   evidence, with equality not promoted to an equivalence;
4. reduced `F5` Homology of `L(5,2)`: four exact returned groups with the
   reduced convention retained;
5. the 5-primary degree-one query: exactly three proven matches, no unresolved
   candidates, and expanded evidence for all three subjects; and
6. representative and induced-map capability states: every
   `not_computed` value remained explicit.

All responses used Snapshot `preview-5ea7db464f937061`. The unit preflight
again passed 12/12 tests. This verifies that the copy-paste prompt exercises
the intended seams; it is not a substitute for Gabriel's or Dan's verdict.

The exact preflight was:

```bash
git status --short
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python3 -m homology_db --db /tmp/homology-db-external-review.sqlite3 demo
```

The database was built exactly once. Every later command used this envelope
and the same database path:

```bash
python3 -m homology_db --db /tmp/homology-db-external-review.sqlite3 tool '<JSON>'
```

The exact ordered payloads for R01--R12 were:

```jsonl

03 {"tool":"expand_evidence","arguments":{"evidence_ids":["preview:evidence:nonorientable_surface:2"]}}

37 {"tool":"resolve_subject","arguments":{"query":"CP^2"}}
38 {"tool":"read_homology","arguments":{"subject":"CP^2","coefficient":"Z"}}
```

The free-form continuation reused the same database and Snapshot. Its three
questions were integral Homology of `N_3`, reduced `F3` Homology of `RP^4`,
and integral Homology of missing subject `CP^3`. Exact payloads:

```jsonl
39 {"tool":"resolve_subject","arguments":{"query":"N_3"}}
40 {"tool":"read_homology","arguments":{"subject":"N_3","coefficient":"Z"}}
41 {"tool":"expand_evidence","arguments":{"evidence_ids":["preview:evidence:nonorientable_surface:3"]}}
42 {"tool":"resolve_subject","arguments":{"query":"RP^4"}}
43 {"tool":"read_homology","arguments":{"subject":"RP^4","coefficient":"F3","reduced":true}}
44 {"tool":"expand_evidence","arguments":{"evidence_ids":["preview:evidence:real_projective_space:4"]}}
45 {"tool":"resolve_subject","arguments":{"query":"CP^3"}}
46 {"tool":"read_homology","arguments":{"subject":"CP^3","coefficient":"Z"}}
```

All 46 responses used Snapshot `preview-5ea7db464f937061`. The two supported
free-form lookups returned exact grounded groups and complete evidence
expansions. `CP^3` returned `not_found` and `subject_not_resolved`, with no
invented assertion or evidence. The final status matched the initial intended
documentation changes.

## Product direction to revisit: a cited implication graph

The intended long-term interface is a graph whose nodes are cited assertions
and whose directed edges are cited implications, constructions, or
invariant-preservation steps. It is optimized for efficient human review:
reviewers should be able to inspect a claim, its incoming justifications, the
status of their hypotheses, competing claims, uncertainty, and correction
history without reading an agent transcript end to end.

This differs deliberately from a proof-assistant workflow whose successful
kernel check is intended to remove the need for human confirmation. The graph
does not replace mathematical judgment. It makes the agent's claimed route
auditable and corrigible. An accepted edge means a named reviewer accepted
that cited implication in its stated scope; rejection or later correction
remains visible.

No graph schema, inference language, trust policy, or UI is fixed by this
entry. Those decisions require a separate design discussion. Until then:

- never materialize an implication without named sources and hypotheses;
- never silently turn an implication into identity or merge its nodes;
- distinguish source testimony, owned computation, deterministic presentation
  rules, and agent-proposed reasoning;
- preserve `unknown`, `not_computed`, conflict, and missing hypotheses; and
- append review and correction events rather than overwriting accepted or
  rejected history.

## Automation checklist for the next review

- Allocate a stable `review_id` before running commands.
- Record commit, clean-tree state, prompt hash/version, agent/runtime, and the
  one Snapshot ID.
- Capture ordered public-operation requests and responses without SQL,
  filesystem lookup, or web retrieval by the answer agent.
- Extract every mathematical claim and require its exact assertion/evidence
  grounding or a typed unsupported outcome.
- Expand evidence once per discussed subject and retain capability states.
- Present claim and implication-edge blocks for human verdicts.
- Append the completed verdicts and new follow-up tickets to this file or its
  future structured successor; do not mutate prior entries.
- Gate hosting on recorded external review and resolution of every critical
  safety or provenance defect.

## Decision `decision-2026-07-12-002`: postpone external review

```text
record_kind: decision
recorded_at: 2026-07-12 (Africa/Johannesburg; exact time not retained)
decision_owner: project owner
repository_commit: 9676d6f (named-atlas execution map)
decision: do not invite Gabriel Ong, Dan Isaksen, or another external mathematical reviewer until named-atlas-review-v1 passes
inputs: review-2026-07-12-001 through review-2026-07-12-005; CP^2 corpus-representativeness concern; production-schema concern
review_gate: grounded RP^0..12 and CP^0..12, named corpus, production-like schema, qualified cross-model slice, definition seam, and adversarial QA with no critical mathematical-safety, schema, or provenance defect
cohort_policy: preserve local-preview-60 unchanged as a regression fixture; it is not the proposed reviewer experience
supersedes_or_corrects: decision-2026-07-12-001 timing and cohort recommendation only
```

This entry preserves the earlier decision rather than rewriting it. Informal
product feedback may still be recorded while the gate is closed; it is not a
database review or an invitation to endorse the current Snapshot.

## Feedback `review-2026-07-12-006`: Gabriel Ong on LMFDB and knowls

reviewer_role: human product adviser; not a database reviewer in this entry
repository_commit: 9676d6f
snapshot_id: not-applicable
source: private messages quoted by the project owner; ICERM video https://icerm.brown.edu/video_archive/4709
feedback: study the LMFDB talk's lessons about setting up a mathematical database, naming, useful graphical representations, and ease of use; prioritize LMFDB knowls as expandable definitions; graphics may come later
verdict: not-applicable (product feedback, not a claim-level mathematical review)
disposition: accepted as named-atlas schema/API/QA input; inline browser rendering and mathematical graphics remain later UI work
follow_up: docs/research/icerm-lmfdb-knowl-review.md; production-schema, public-operation, QA, and final-audit tickets in named-atlas-review-v1
supersedes_or_corrects: none
```

The term is **knowl** (plural **knowls**). The recording's caption track
misrecognizes it as “nulls”; the presenter-authored slides and official LMFDB
documentation confirm the spelling.

audit_conclusion: knowls are stable reusable inline exposition with revision/review history; meaningful persistent labels, scoped completeness, source/reliability disclosure, stored searchable computations, and mathematically encoded graphics are relevant design precedents
project_disposition: require versioned Snapshot-selected definition records and knowledge references in the existing four operation envelopes; never treat definition prose as assertion evidence; defer inline dropdowns and graphics to the later UI tier
human_review_state: pending-human-review
follow_up: named-atlas-review-v1 tickets 03, 08, 09, and 10

## Communication plan `review-2026-07-12-008`: reviewer Loom walkthrough

```text
review_id: review-2026-07-12-008
record_kind: external-review-communication-plan
recorded_at: 2026-07-12 (Africa/Johannesburg; exact time retained in Git history)
reviewer: project owner and Codex planning pass
reviewer_role: communication planning; not mathematical review
repository_commit: 33e91c2 (atlas checkpoint before this communication-plan commit)
snapshot_id: not-applicable
artifact: docs/LOOM_WALKTHROUGH.md
audience: Gabriel Ong and Dan Isaksen
plan: rehearse internally against local-preview-60; record and send the external cut only after named-atlas-review-v1 passes
video_thesis: AI navigates four read-only operations over an immutable human-reviewable graph of cited claims and implications
required_demonstrations: grounded CP^2; CP^12/CP^13 materialization boundary; equal-Homology comparison safety; Snapshot-bounded torsion search; typed unsupported/not_computed outcome; reviewed definition distinct from assertion evidence
email_assets: Loom URL, public repository URL, pinned commit, copy-paste read-only reviewer prompt, role-specific requests, and explicit request for reject/needs-evidence verdicts
send_gate: append-only decision superseding decision-2026-07-12-002 after all named-atlas critical gates pass
current_disposition: planned, not recorded, not sent
supersedes_or_corrects: none
```

The detailed [reviewer Loom walkthrough plan](LOOM_WALKTHROUGH.md) includes a
timed storyboard, internal-rehearsal substitutions, final recording checklist,
email draft, reviewer prompt, and the metadata block to append after recording.
Preparing the communication does not reopen the external-review gate.

## Correction `review-2026-07-12-009`: simplify the Loom to four minutes

```text
review_id: review-2026-07-12-009
record_kind: external-review-communication-plan-correction
recorded_at: 2026-07-12 (Africa/Johannesburg; exact time retained in Git history)
decision_owner: project owner
artifact: docs/LOOM_WALKTHROUGH.md
decision: replace the 7--9 minute multi-demonstration storyboard with a four-minute development preview
timing: 0:00--2:00 current capabilities and explicit absences; 2:00--3:00 one named-space/coefficient lookup; 3:00--4:00 one Snapshot-bounded Homology-pattern example search
deferred_extension: example retrieval by Homotopy data, and later combined Homology/Homotopy/spectral-sequence patterns
sharing_semantics: before named-atlas-review-v1 passes, the Loom may orient informal product testing but is not the external mathematical review or corpus-approval request
supersedes_or_corrects: review-2026-07-12-008 storyboard, email, and recording scope only; decision-2026-07-12-002 review gate remains in force
```

The revised plan intentionally omits schema, migration, knowl, implication-
graph, family-boundary, and adversarial-review tours. Those topics made the
orientation obscure the two interactions being tested.

## Communication artifact `review-2026-07-12-010`: no-terminal Codex workspace

review_id: review-2026-07-12-010
record_kind: external-review-communication-artifact
recorded_at: 2026-07-12 (Africa/Johannesburg; exact time retained in Git history)
decision_owner: project owner
artifact: LOOM_START_HERE.md
purpose: let the presenter prepare and run the four-minute Loom entirely through Codex without personally invoking Python or terminal commands
preflight: one read-only Codex prompt runs 41 tests, builds /tmp/homology-db-loom.sqlite3 once, verifies the 60-subject Snapshot, and returns a compact READY FOR LOOM card
spoken_script: 264-word introduction describing current and absent capabilities
on_camera_prompts: coefficient-qualified RP^4/F2 lookup; Snapshot-bounded 5-primary H_1 example search
fallback: one compression prompt preserves grounding and coverage while shortening an unexpectedly long Codex answer
supersedes_or_corrects: implements review-2026-07-12-009; does not change the mathematical-review gate
```
